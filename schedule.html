						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<img src="images/420.png" width="40px"/><h2>Friday, April 20</h2>
							<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold;">8:00pm - 11:00pm : Straight to Ale</p>
							<p>A welcome gathering will be held for all wedding guests in town on Friday night, starting around 8pm.
								We'll be at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MxneasB8Hf72" target="_blank">Straight to Ale (map)</a> in Huntsville.
								Straight to Ale is an old high school that has been converted into a brewery
								- delighting us with the perfect fusion of education and beer!
								Shout out to Pop (Stephanie's grandfather and candidate for best dressed at the wedding) who graduated from this school when he himself was
								first discovering beer, and to Jera (Stephanie's cousin and bridesmaid) who currently manages the beer flow. We're looking into shuttles
								 to/from the hotels and there are ubers in the area. Check back for more info on the shuttles, but either way please do not plan to drink and drive.
							</p>

							<img src="images/421.png" width="40px"/><h2>Saturday, April 21</h2>
							<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold">Before the wedding</p>
							<p>
								Downtown Huntsville has plenty to explore during the day. Hiking, disc golf, Top Golf,
								 breweries, and a space museum are some of the activites we recommend. See the <a href="plan.html">Plan your trip</a> page
								  for more details.
							</p>
							<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold">5:00pm - 6:00pm : Wedding Ceremony</p>
							<p>
								The wedding ceremony will begin at 5:00 so please plan to show up 4:30-4:45ish. Being fashionably late to a
								wedding ceremony isn't as cool as you might think.
							</p>
							<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold">6:00pm - 7:00pm : Dinner</p>
							<p>
								The reception will begin immediately following the ceremony, so be prepared for some delicious southern cuisine.
								We'll supply the napkins to keep your nice clothes sauce and grease-free.
							</p>
							<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold">7:00pm - 10:00pm : So you think you can dance?</p>
							<p>
								After dinner the band will come on and we'll have our own version of SYTYCD (Stephanie's favorite show
								if you've been paying attention). If you don't think you can dance, we encourage you to try anyway.
								Rumor has it the venue provides games (e.g. shuffle board) incase you need to hide from the dance floor for a song or two.
							</p>
							<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold">10:00pm - ? : After Party</p>
							<p>
								The reception will end at 10, but The Lumberyard will have a late-night band playing inside for those of us still awake.
								 There is a free trolley that stops at The Lumberyard and circles through the hotels/downtown every half hour
								 until 2am. Ubers will also be available. Again, please do not drink and drive.

							<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold">10:00am - 2:00pm : Rocket Brunch</p>
							<p>
								We'll be doing a light, casual Sunday brunch at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/zLAEku4jaUz" target="_blank">
									U.S. Space and Rocket Center (map)</a>. We'll have museum tickets available
								 if you feel like exploring, or feel free to just stop by for some coffee/breakfast in the courtyard.
								  Please don't feel obligated to join, but it may be a good excuse
								  to check out this awesome museum and eat a donut if you're into space and sugar and stuff. The museum is pretty close
									to the Huntsville Airport (and on the way to Nashville) so it could be a convenient stop on your way out!
