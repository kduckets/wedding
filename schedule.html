						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<img src="images/420.png" width="40px"/><h2>Friday, April 20</h2>
							<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold;">6:00pm - 8:00pm : Family meet and greet at Yellowhammer</p>
							<p>Families are invited to
								<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Mkev2pULRrj" target="_blank">Yellowhammer Brewing (map)</a> for an informal dinner and meet and greet. Yellowhammer is
								directly next to Straight to Ale, where the welcome party will be held (see below).
							<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold;">8:00pm - 11:00pm : Straight to Ale Welcome Party</p>
							<p>A welcome gathering will be held for all wedding guests in town on Friday night, starting around 8pm
								at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MxneasB8Hf72" target="_blank">Straight to Ale (map)</a>.
								Straight to Ale is an old high school that has been converted into a brewery
								- delighting us with the extraordinary fusion of education and beer!
								Shout out to Pop (Stephanie's grandfather and candidate for best dressed at the wedding) who graduated from this school when he himself was
								first discovering beer, and to Jera (Stephanie's cousin and bridesmaid) who currently manages the beer flow. Please use Lyft/Uber if you plan on drinking.

							<img src="images/421.png" width="40px"/><h2>Saturday, April 21</h2>
							<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold">Before the wedding</p>
							<p>
								Downtown Huntsville has plenty to explore during the day. Hiking, disc golf, Top Golf,
								 breweries, and a space museum are some of the activites we recommend. See the <a href="plan.html">Plan your trip</a> page
								  for more details.
							</p>
							<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold">5:00pm - 6:00pm : Wedding Ceremony</p>
							<p>
								The wedding ceremony will begin at 5:00 so please plan to show up 4:30-4:45ish. Being fashionably late to a
								wedding ceremony isn't as cool as you might think. We will have a
								shuttle (actually, a party bus...) doing rounds from the Embassy Suites to the venue starting at 3:45pm. There is a trolley that
								will take you home at the end of the night (see below). Alternatively, you can drive and leave your car at the Lumberyard overnight. Lyft/Uber is also an option (we like options).
							</p>
							<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold">6:00pm - 7:00pm : Dinner</p>
							<p>
								The reception will begin immediately following the ceremony, so be prepared for some delicious southern cuisine.
								We'll supply the napkins to keep your nice clothes sauce and grease-free.
							</p>
							<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold">7:00pm - 10:00pm : So you think you can dance?</p>
							<p>
								After dinner the band will take the stage and we'll have our own version of SYTYCD (Stephanie's favorite show
								if you've been paying attention). If you don't think you can dance (Kev can't), we encourage you to try anyway.
								Rumor has it the venue provides games (e.g. shuffle board) in case you need to hide from the dance floor for a song or two (Kev will).
							</p>
							<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold">10:00pm - ? : After Party</p>
							<p>
								The reception ends at 10, but The Lumberyard will have a late-night band playing inside the bar for those of us still awake.
								 There is a free trolley that stops at The Lumberyard and circles through the hotels/downtown every half hour
								 until 2am. Ubers will also be available. Again, no need to drink and drive. We don't have many rules.

							<img src="images/422.png" width="40px"/><h2>Sunday, April 22</h2>
							<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold">10:00am - 2:00pm : Rocket Brunch</p>
							<p>
								We'll be doing a light, casual Sunday brunch at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/zLAEku4jaUz" target="_blank">
									U.S. Space and Rocket Center (map)</a>. We'll have museum tickets available
								 if you feel like exploring, or feel free to just stop by for some coffee/breakfast in the courtyard.
								  Please don't feel obligated to join, but it may be a good excuse
								  to check out this awesome museum and eat a donut if you're into space and sugar and stuff. The museum is pretty close
									to the Huntsville Airport (and on the way to Nashville) so it could be a convenient stop on your way out.
